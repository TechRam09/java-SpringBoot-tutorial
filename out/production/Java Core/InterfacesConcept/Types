There are three types of Interface

1) Normal Interface :  interface with two or more methods
ex: interface AbC{
    void show();
    void config();
}


2) Functional Interface / SAM : interface with only one method is called Functional Interfaces
it is also called as SAM [ Single Abstract Method interface]
ex: interface Demo{
    void show();
}

3) Marker Interface : interface without any method is called Marker Interfaces
ex: interface Marker{

}
