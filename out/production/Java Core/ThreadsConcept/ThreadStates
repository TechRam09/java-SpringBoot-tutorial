                                       Dead state [Not recommended, Deprecated]

New State : when the thread is created(Thread t1 = new Thread())
Runnable State : When ever we call start method thread go to runnable state(t1.start())
Running State: When run method is called it is running state
Difference between
runnable and running is When the thread is actually running in CPU it is running state
when the thread is executing and waiting for scheduler is runnable state.

Waiting state: when we want hold the thread to wait we use sleep or wait method
Thread comeback from waiting state runnable state using notify

Dead State: from runnable we can also keep thread in dead state using stop() which is deprecated
