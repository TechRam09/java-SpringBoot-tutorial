what are  threads?
when build a software it runs on hardware which contains CPU and RAM with the help of OS
when the software wants to add 2 numbers that operation go to OS and OS sends the request to CPU and CPU does processing and provide output
if we running big software , in our system we will be having multiple software and sometimes we want to run it on same time
then OS should support multitasking, it is not that they are executing at the same time
In CPU there is concept called Time Sharing , they execute the task by sharing the time of execution
Same in case a Single Task if we want to break down the task into multiple sub task it is possible
for ex: we using software if we are writing on something as soon as we type it is displayed and a sound it not about multitasking
it is about dividing the task into smallest unit that is where threads are used

Threads are lightweight Smallest unit of process / task is called Threads
we multiple threads for single task / process
they can work parallely and they share resources
